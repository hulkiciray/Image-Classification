# Image-Classification

In this repo, we are going to build our image classification model with PyTorch. It will be a basic introductory repo for those who would like a fresh start with computer vision.

### About the Dataset
This is a very high quality dataset of playing card images. All images are 224 X 224 X 3 in jpg format. All images in the dataset have been cropped so that only the image of a single card is present and the card occupies well over 50% of the pixels in the image. There are 7624 training images, 265 test images and 265 validation images. The train, test and validation directories are partitioned into 53 sub directories , one for each of the 53 types of cards. The dataset also includes a csv file which can be used to load the datasets.
